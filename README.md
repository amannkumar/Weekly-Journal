Week 1: Jan 18-Jan 27

Date: 27 Jan 2024

Key Concepts Learned: Started learning backend development in NodeJS which is based on JavaScript language. Started off with covering basics in the programming language to working on OS paths, http modules and learning about sync vs async programming,

Application in Real Projects: The learnings would help me become a better software developer by understanding the backend of the software.

Peer Interactions: Discussing to participate in the cybersecurity hackathon hosted by Concordia.

Challenges Faced: Challenges faced while learning the new backend language during development and in class trying to understand some practical examples for the class SDM.

Personal development activities: Started surfing through the internet to find ways that would help in gaining real world experience.

Goals for the Next Week: Set specific learning goals for the upcoming week. Consider areas where you want to focus for deeper understanding. Build projects on NodeJS and express. Focus on classes and getting internships.

Week 2: Jan 28- Feb. 3

Date: 2 Feb 2024

Key Concepts Learned:
This week I learned about software risk and the ways to manage it. I learned the kinds of risks exist for a project, the impact may risks have on a project, the strategy is needed to deal with risks.

Reflections on Case Study/course work:
While I was working on my personal project, I tried to refactor code after reading the impacts of risk assessment. This helped me to increase my output in my code base by removing few bug fixes

Collaborative Learning:
Reflect on collaborative experiences or group activities during the week.
Consider how working with peers contributed to your understanding.
The collaborative experience with my peers has taught me the way through which we can integrate third party Apiâ€™s to get the maximum output.

Further Research/Readings:
To improve my backend development skills, I have started implementing a backend project by reading the documentation for the library. It taught me a lot of things such as importance of sync, async, streams, event loops etc.

Adjustments to Goals:
Review the goals: Learnt a lot of basic Node.Js and javascript and express. 
Goals for next week: build few basic and intermediate node and express projects. Start building your own website through flutter and understand software architecture such as MVVM, MVC.


Final Reflections:

Overall Course Impact: The course until now has helped in the understanding of feasibility when it comes to software development. It has also helped me to understand the risk factors associated when it comes to building a new project and budget of the project.

Application in Professional Life: With trying to build my own personal website. The course has taught me to manage the implementation of the development to get maximum output and also taught me time management.

Peer Collaboration Insights: Did not have any peer collaborations till now.

Personal Growth: Not seen yet.
